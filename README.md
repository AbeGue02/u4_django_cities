# Django Cities

For this lab we are going to create a mock travel database, with a number of attractions across a number of cities, all of which have a number of reviews

## Requirements 

1) Create a Django project with 3 related models, Cities -> Attractions -> Reviews
2) There should be at least 2 cities, with 3 attractions each. Add at least 2 reviews to at least 2 attractions
